# Operations for Little Babies #

A presentation given at Pivotal Tech Talks NYC. And it's actually the extended edition
of a talk given at [hackNY Masters][1] [(github)][2].

This HTML slideshow is modified from the [Google I/O slides][3].

## Abstract ##

This year, GroupMe jumped ship from their PaaS, and began building an ops
infrastructure on AWS. This talk highlights their motivations, a detailed
look at their current and future operations, and lessons learned.
